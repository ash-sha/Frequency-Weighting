# Frequency-Weighting
Enhanced Text Classification through various Frequency Weighting proposes the estimation of improving accuracy through implying various weighting strategies in SVM and Maximum Entropy algorithms using Yelp review dataset.
Modelled using SVM, Maximum Entropy and various weightings of weighSMART function in R programming. Due to its limitations in build-in function, altered the source code of R package and expanded the new document weights and produced a better accuracy of 79% & 92%.
