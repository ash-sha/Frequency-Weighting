# Frequency-Weighting
Enhanced Text Classification through various Frequency Weighting proposes the estimation of improving accuracy through implying various weighting strategies( Empirical MI, Miller-Madow, Schurmann-Grassberger and Shrink) in SVM and Maximum Entropy algorithms using Mice Protein Expression, Zoo, Segmentation and Wall Following datasets of UCI Repository.
Due to its limitations in build-in function of WeightSmart, altered the source code of R package and expanded the new document weights and produced a better accuracy of 97.68%, 63%, 90.23%, 94.37% .
